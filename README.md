# Binary-Classification-Python-vs-scikit-learn
 Several regression and binary classification algorithms are available in scikit-learn. 
 In this part I am first classifying the quality of wine using map function (threshold) 
 of python then I used LabelBinarizer preprocessing function of scikit-learn method to 
 classify wine either 0 or 1.
